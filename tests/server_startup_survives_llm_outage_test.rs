//! Starting a server must not require the LLM backend to be reachable.
//!
//! The model is needed to answer traffic, not to open a socket. Three protocols called
//! `call_llm` from inside `spawn()` and propagated the error with `?`, so an Ollama outage —
//! or simply a wrong `--ollama-url` — made `spawn()` return `Err` and the server never started
//! at all:
//!
//! * `nfc` — `nfc_server_started`, to configure the virtual tag's ATR and NDEF records
//! * `usb-smartcard` — `usb_smartcard_reader_ready`, to configure the card's ATR
//! * `bluetooth_ble` — `bluetooth_ble_started`, to add GATT services and start advertising
//!
//! All three now log the failure at ERROR on both channels and carry on. `nfc` and
//! `usb-smartcard` have real built-in defaults (tag type/UID/ATR, and `DEFAULT_ATR` with a card
//! inserted), so an unconfigured server is still a working one; `bluetooth_ble` has none, so it
//! comes up powered but advertising nothing and says exactly that. In every case a backend blip
//! no longer takes down a server that would have worked for every peer arriving afterwards.
//!
//! The LLM endpoint here is `http://127.0.0.1:1` — connection-refused on the first packet, so
//! this *is* the outage, not a simulation of one. Nothing external is contacted.
//!
//! ```bash
//! ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features nfc,usb-smartcard \
//!     --test server_startup_survives_llm_outage_test -- --test-threads=100
//! ```
