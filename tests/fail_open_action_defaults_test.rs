//! A forgotten field in an action must never be read as a successful outcome.
//!
//! # The bug class
//!
//! The dangerous shape here is not "the LLM was wrong", it is "the LLM said nothing about
//! this field and the executor supplied a success". OAuth2 was the reference case and is
//! fixed; these are the same shape found elsewhere, in the parameter defaults rather than in
//! the no-action branch:
//!
//! - `send_imap_response` defaulted `status` to `"OK"`. A tagged response with no status
//!   rendered `A001 OK`, and `handle_auth` reads a tagged OK as a successful LOGIN — so a
//!   dropped field authenticated the session. RFC 3501 §7.1 gives a tagged response no
//!   default condition.
//! - `ldap_add_response` / `ldap_modify_response` / `ldap_delete_response` defaulted
//!   `success` to `true`, which selects resultCode 0 — the directory telling the client the
//!   write landed. (`ldap_bind_response` was always correctly `false`; only the three write
//!   operations fell open.)
//!
//! # Why the LDAP assertions compare encodings instead of decoding BER
//!
//! The responses are hand-rolled BER, and a test that re-implements the decoder would pass
//! whenever the two implementations agreed on being wrong together. Comparing an omitted
//! field against both explicit spellings is stronger and needs no decoder: the omission must
//! encode byte-for-byte what an explicit failure encodes, and must differ from an explicit
//! success. That holds regardless of how resultCode is framed on the wire.
