//! FIDO2 approval manager: concurrency and identity.
//!
//! The single-request contract — approve, deny, unanswered-denies, unknown-id-errors — is
//! asserted in `tests/server/usb_fido2/e2e_test.rs::test_approval_manager_contract`, next to the
//! end-to-end tests that depend on it. What is left here is the part those cannot reach: **more
//! than one request in flight at once**, which is what the approval id exists for.
//!
//! That matters because the model answers by quoting an id back. If ids were not unique per
//! manager, or if resolving one request could satisfy another, an approval meant for one relying
//! party would be applied to a different one — and since an unanswered request denies, the
//! victim would look like a timeout rather than a mix-up.
//!
//! These used to call `list_pending().await`, `approve(id).await` and `deny(id).await`. The
//! whole manager was async, reached from the synchronous USB/IP handler through
//! `tokio::runtime::Handle::current().block_on(...)`, which panics on a tokio worker: *"Cannot
//! block the current thread from within a runtime"*. It is synchronous now, and these tests
//! calling it without `.await` is the visible half of that fix.
