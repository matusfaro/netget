//! Guard against re-growing the hand-rolled `[LEVEL]` TUI sends that the logging facade
//! is meant to replace.
//!
//! The TUI bracket prefix (`[INFO]`, `[DEBUG]`, …) must be produced by exactly one place:
//! `logging::emit::Log`, which derives it from the same `Level` value it logs to the file
//! with. Anything that hand-writes a `"[LEVEL]"` string literal to send to the TUI can
//! drift from its file-log level (that was the whole bug).
//!
//! Scope: `src/llm/` only. The ~1245 hand-rolled sites in `src/server/*` / `src/client/*`
//! are the later per-protocol sweep and are intentionally NOT covered here. Within
//! `src/llm/` we still tolerate the not-yet-migrated sites via a per-file BASELINE that
//! records the *current* count — the "allowlist that starts full and shrinks": a file may
//! only ever have FEWER `[LEVEL]` literals than its baseline, never more. A file with no
//! entry must have zero. As Step 4 migrates a file to the facade, lower its baseline.
//!
//! (A string-literal count, rather than a `.send(...)` parse, is deliberate: it is robust
//! to multi-line `send(format!(...))` calls and also catches a `[LEVEL]` string built for
//! the TUI a few lines before it is sent.)
