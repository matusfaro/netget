//! Reject mock rules that answer an event with an action the protocol cannot execute.
//!
//! Three suites have now been found mocking an action name belonging to a *different*
//! protocol (`send_jsonrpc_response` in the MCP tests, `send_token_response` in the OAuth2
//! tests, `write_file` in the HTTP tests). In each case the server rejected the action as
//! unknown, answered with its fallback, and the test either failed for an opaque reason or
//! — worse — passed, because its assertions accepted the fallback.
//!
//! `0069d90c` added exactly this check for `event_handlers` at `start_server` time. This is
//! the same check applied to mock rules, so the class is caught in tests too. The catalog is
//! read from the same registries the server uses, and the test binary is compiled with the
//! same feature set as the `netget` binary it drives, so the two see the same protocols.
//!
//! Deliberately *not* validated:
//! - rules that do not match on an event id (`on_instruction_containing`, `on_any`, …):
//!   those answer a user command, where the vocabulary is the common actions;
//! - `respond_with_actions_from_event`, whose actions are built by a closure at runtime;
//! - event ids no compiled protocol declares — the protocol is simply not in this build,
//!   so there is no catalog to check against and guessing would produce false failures.
