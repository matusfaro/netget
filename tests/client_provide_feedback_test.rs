//! `provide_feedback` was advertised to clients and no client could execute it.
//!
//! `call_llm_for_client` injects `common::provide_feedback_action()` into the tool list of any
//! client that was started with `feedback_instructions`. Every client then hands the model's
//! actions straight to its own `Client::execute_action`, which knows only its protocol's
//! vocabulary — so a model that used the tool it was offered had the call rejected as an
//! *unknown action*, retried, and finally dropped. The same fail-open shape as elsewhere in
//! this tree, one level up: the model is shown a tool it is then punished for using.
//!
//! The server path never had this problem because `executor::execute_actions` tries
//! `CommonAction::from_json` before the protocol. Clients never reach that executor, so the fix
//! splits the common actions out inside `call_llm_for_client` — the one place that advertises
//! them — and runs them through the very same executor the server path uses.
//!
//! `tests/event_action_declarations_test.rs` cannot catch this: its executor round-trip walks
//! `client_llm_action_set(...)`, which is the union of the *protocol's* declarations and
//! deliberately does not include an action injected by the caller. This file is the guard for
//! the injected half, in both directions — an advertised name with no handler, and a handler
//! for a name nothing advertises.
//!
//! ```bash
//! ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features tcp \
