//! DataLink declaration tests: what the protocol promises the model, and what the startup path
//! accepts. No privileges, no Ollama - the wire behaviour lives in `e2e_test.rs`.
//!
//! What was here before: `test_arp_responder`, which shelled out to `arping` and printed a note
//! on *every* outcome - reply, no reply, `arping` missing - then returned `Ok(())`. Its failure
//! branch read *"No ARP reply received (this is expected if server isn't fully implemented)"*: a
//! test announcing its own meaninglessness. It also tested a premise that cannot hold. DataLink
//! has **no packet-injection action**, so a DataLink server can never answer an ARP request, and
//! no amount of privilege would have made it pass. Answering ARP is `src/server/arp/`'s job and
//! `tests/server/arp/e2e_test.rs` covers it. Replaced below by assertions that can fail.
