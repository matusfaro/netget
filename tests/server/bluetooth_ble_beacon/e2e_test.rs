//! End-to-end tests for the BLE beacon server.
//!
//! # What can and cannot be tested here
//!
//! A beacon is advertisement-only: there is no connection to open, no request to send and no
//! response to read back. Confirming that a frame is really on air needs a second radio running
//! a scanner, so the only true end-to-end check is a Linux host with `bluetoothd`, an adapter,
//! and something like `btmon` or nRF Connect watching. That is out of reach for CI and for this
//! machine, and pretending otherwise is how this protocol came to be documented as working when
//! it was not.
//!
//! What *is* tested here is the full protocol path up to the radio: the registry entry, the
//! declared startup parameters, and — on a platform that cannot set an advertising payload —
//! that `spawn()` returns an error naming the reason instead of reporting a running server.
//! The advertising octets themselves are covered exhaustively in `payload_test.rs`.
//!
//! The previous version of this file spawned the netget binary three times and asserted that a
//! server started, while the protocol could not emit a beacon frame at all. It verified the
//! base GATT stack's LLM plumbing and called it beacon coverage.
