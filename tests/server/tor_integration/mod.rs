//! Tor Network Integration Tests
//!
//! This module provides comprehensive E2E tests that integrate all three components:
//! - Official Tor client (or arti-client as fallback)
//! - NetGet Tor Relay
//! - NetGet Tor Directory
//!
//! These tests create a minimal local Tor network and validate end-to-end functionality.
