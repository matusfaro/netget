//! The Tor client must not reach the public internet by default.
//!
//! `arti_client::TorClient::create_bootstrapped()` contacts the real Tor directory authorities
//! **before it looks at the requested address** — 14 seconds in an unguarded run. So merely
//! opening a Tor client made outbound connections to third parties whatever destination the
//! user asked for, in a tool that binds loopback everywhere else, and the whole-registry
//! startup smoke test had to carve out a named exclusion for Tor rather than run it.
//!
//! `bootstrap_target()` is the guard, and these tests pin it. Nothing here touches the
//! network — that is the point: the refusal happens before any I/O, which is exactly what
//! `connect_without_an_opt_in_is_refused_before_any_network_io` measures.
//!
//! ```bash
//! ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features tor \
//!     --test client -- client::tor::test --test-threads=100
