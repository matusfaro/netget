//! Hold-timer enforcement for the BGP client (RFC 4271 sections 4.2, 6.5 and 10).
//!
//! A BGP speaker MUST drop the session when its Hold Timer expires — no KEEPALIVE, UPDATE or
//! NOTIFICATION within the negotiated hold time — sending a NOTIFICATION with error code 4
//! (Hold Timer Expired) first. The client used to send keepalives at the negotiated cadence and
//! enforce nothing, so a peer that went silent was noticed only when TCP eventually noticed:
//! many minutes on a live connection, and never on a half-open one with no traffic.
//!
//! ## Why these tests drive the protocol directly
//!
//! `e2e_test.rs` in this directory drives a NetGet BGP *server* through the mock-Ollama harness,
//! which is the right shape for "does the session come up". It is the wrong shape here for two
//! reasons: the peer has to go *deliberately silent*, which a working NetGet server never does,
//! and the assertion is about specific octets — `wire::MSG_NOTIFICATION`, error code 4 — not
//! about an event firing. So the peer is a raw `TcpStream` that speaks BGP by hand, and the
//! assertions are on the bytes it reads.
//!
//! No Ollama is needed or contacted. The model name is pinned in `AppState` so
//! `ensure_model_selected` never probes `localhost:11434`, and the LLM endpoint is
//! `127.0.0.1:1`, so the one model call the client makes (on `bgp_connected`) fails with
//! connection-refused and is logged — the same path a real client takes when the backend is
//! down. That the hold timer still fires *while the read loop is off in a failing LLM call* is
//! part of what is being tested: the timer lives in its own task for exactly that reason.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features bgp \
//!       --test client -- --test-threads=100 bgp
