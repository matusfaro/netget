//! Tests that prompt-time and runtime tool classification agree (IMPROVEMENTS.md item 14).
//!
//! `build_actions_section_public` renders an action under one of two headings whose
//! boilerplate makes opposite promises: the "Available Tools" heading says the model will be
//! invoked again with the result, the "Available Actions" heading says it will not. Which
//! heading an action lands under is decided by `ActionDefinition::is_tool()`. Whether the
//! model *is actually* re-invoked is decided by `ToolAction::is_tool_action()`. If those two
//! disagree, the prompt states something false — which it did for `read_documentation`, the
//! primary discovery tool.
