//! Regression guard: stopping a packet-capture server must actually stop the capture.
//!
//! `arp`, `datalink`, `icmp` and `isis` ran their loop in a detached
//! `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` whose `JoinHandle` was **discarded**. Nothing was registered
//! with `AppState::register_server_task`, and there was no shutdown signal of any kind, so on a
//! host with the privileges to actually run them (root, `/dev/bpf*` on macOS/BSD, `CAP_NET_RAW`
//! on Linux) `stop_server` left the capture running until the process exited — still capturing,
//! still calling the LLM for every packet, while the operator believed it had stopped.
//!
//! The startup smoke test cannot catch this: on an unprivileged machine these protocols
//! correctly *refuse to start*, so the sweep never reaches the stop path. That is precisely why
//! it survived every previous audit of this family.
//!
//! Registering the handle is necessary but **not sufficient**, and that is the subtle part:
//! `JoinHandle::abort()` cannot interrupt a thread parked inside `pcap::Capture::next_packet()`
//! or `Socket::recv_from()`. Tokio can only cancel a task at an await point, and a blocking
//! loop has none. The fix is therefore two pieces that must both be present:
//!
//! 1. a [`StopSignal`] the blocking loop polls every iteration, and
//! 2. a parked Tokio task registered via `register_server_task` that trips the signal when it
//!    is aborted — so the existing stop plumbing drives it with no new API.
//!
//! # What runs where
//!
//! | Test | Privilege | Asserts |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `stop_signal_ends_a_blocking_loop_when_the_server_is_removed` | none | the mechanism: `remove_server` → abort → flag → blocking loop exits |
//! | `a_dropped_park_task_handle_does_not_trip_the_signal` | none | the signal is tripped by cancellation, not by mere detachment |
//! | `arp_capture_stops_when_the_server_is_removed` | capture | the real ARP capture loop exits |
//! | `datalink_capture_stops_when_the_server_is_removed` | capture | the real DataLink capture loop exits |
//! | `isis_capture_stops_when_the_server_is_removed` | capture | the real IS-IS capture loop exits |
//! | `icmp_receive_loop_stops_when_the_server_is_removed` | raw sockets (root) | the real ICMP receive loop exits |
//!
//! The four privileged tests are `#[ignore]`d, so cargo reports them as *ignored* and never as
//! passed. When they are invoked (`--ignored`) on a process that lacks the privilege they
//! **fail loudly** rather than skipping: a skip that reads as a pass is the exact failure mode
//! this codebase keeps hitting.
//!
//! **They have not been run.** The machine this was written on is macOS with
//! `crw------- root:wheel /dev/bpf*` and no root, and `sudo` was not available; the mechanism
//! tests below are what *is* verified. Run the privileged half with:
//!
//! ```bash
//! sudo -E ./cargo-isolated.sh test --no-default-features --features arp,datalink,icmp,isis \
//!     --test capture_stop_releases_capture_test -- --ignored --test-threads=100
//! ```
