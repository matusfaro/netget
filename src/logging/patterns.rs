//! Shared log pattern constants
//!
//! These constants are used both for logging and for test assertions.
//! When a log pattern changes, the tests that wait for it automatically update.
//!
//! ## Usage in Code
//! ```ignore
//! info!("{} {} connected to {}", patterns::TCP_CLIENT, client_id, remote_addr);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Usage in Tests
//! ```ignore
//! client.wait_for_pattern(patterns::TCP_CLIENT_CONNECTED, Duration::from_secs(5)).await?;
//! ```

// summaries are DEBUG/Sink::FileOnly so they never reach the status stream a test
// observes. Nothing referenced them. A pattern that cannot match is worse than an
// absent one — it turns "this never happened" into a timeout somewhere unrelated.
