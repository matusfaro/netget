//! Answering a request yourself.
//!
//! A `manual` routing rule parks each matched event as a pending question
//! (`crate::state::intercepts`); this modal is where the human answers it. It
//! shows what arrived and offers exactly three things to do:
//!
//! - **Compose answer…** opens the same composer the `[ send ]` rows use —
//!   pick one of the protocol's actions from a list, fill its parameters as
//!   fields (booleans toggle), and send. Raw JSON is one button away for the
//!   rare shape the fields cannot express, never the starting point.
//! - **Answer with nothing** delivers zero actions: acknowledge, say nothing.
//!   That is a real answer — the same as an empty static handler, and what a
//!   lifecycle event like connection-opened usually deserves — so it is
//!   delivered (Ok) and distinct from a timeout (Err).
//! - **Fail closed** refuses: the waiting dispatcher errors immediately and
//!   the peer gets the protocol's category error, exactly as if the model had
//!   failed. Refusing is honest; inventing nothing is the fail-closed rule.
