//! User-presence approval for FIDO2/U2F operations.
//!
//! A security key does not decide anything by itself: a credential is created, or an assertion
//! is signed, only when a human touches the button. This module is where that human is replaced
//! by the model, and it is the one genuinely LLM-shaped decision in the protocol — *should this
//! relying party get a credential / an assertion, right now?*
//!
//! # Why none of this is a `block_on` bridge any more
//!
//! It used to be described as a "sync/async bridge": `handle_urb` is synchronous and is called
//! by `usbip` from a tokio worker, so the CTAP2 handler reached the async approval manager with
//! `tokio::runtime::Handle::current().block_on(...)`. That panics —
//! *"Cannot block the current thread from within a runtime"* — so **every** MakeCredential and
//! GetAssertion killed the connection task, and so did `execute_action("approve_request")` from
//! the model. The same defect is documented for `usb/msc/handler.rs`; this is the second
//! instance of it.
//!
//! There is no bridge now. The seam is CTAPHID itself, which is asynchronous by design: a real
//! authenticator answers the host with `KEEPALIVE(UPNEEDED)` while it waits for the button.
//! So the handler *asks* (returns [`UserPresence::Ask`] as an [`ApprovalDetails`]), the
//! connection task raises the event and awaits the model, and the decision is fed back into the
//! handler, which replays the command. Nothing blocks, and every lock in here is a
//! `std::sync` lock that the synchronous handler and the async connection task can both take.
//!
//! # Fail-closed
//!
//! `timeout_decision` is [`ApprovalDecision::Denied`] and there is no code path that turns a
//! missing answer into an approval. A model that says nothing, a model that errors, and a model
//! that is unreachable all produce a denial — and the model's *explicit* denial is a distinct
//! action (`deny_request`) rather than the absence of one. `auto_approve` exists, is off by
//! default, and has to be asked for by name in `startup_params`.
